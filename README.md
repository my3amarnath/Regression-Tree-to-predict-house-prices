# Regression Tree to predict house prices

## Objective
Our objective to  learn how to build and train Regression Trees using Scikit-Learn. You will then use Regression Trees to predict house prices.

SVM works by mapping data to a high-dimensional feature space so that data points can be categorized, even when the data are not otherwise linearly separable. A separator between the categories is found, then the data is transformed in such a way that the separator could be drawn as a hyperplane. Following this, characteristics of new data can be used to predict the group to which a new record should belong

## Introduction to Data set

Imagine you are a data scientist working for a real estate company that is planning to invest in Boston real estate. You have collected information about various areas of Boston and are tasked with created a model that can predict the median price of houses for that area so it can be used to make offers.

The dataset had information on areas/towns not individual houses, the features are

|Field name|Description|
|--- |--- |
|CRIM| Crime per capita|
|ZN| Proportion of residential land zoned for lots over 25,000 sq.ft.|
|INDUS| Proportion of non-retail business acres per town|
|CHAS| Charles River dummy variable (= 1 if tract bounds river; 0 otherwise)|
|NOX| Nitric oxides concentration (parts per 10 million)|
|RM| Average number of rooms per dwelling|
|AGE| Proportion of owner-occupied units built prior to 1940|
|DIS| Weighted distances to Ô¨Åve Boston employment centers|
|RAD| Index of accessibility to radial highways|
|TAX| Full-value property-tax rate per $10,000|
|PTRAIO| Pupil-teacher ratio by town|
|LSTAT| Percent lower status of the population|
|MEDV| Median value of owner-occupied homes in $1000s|

For the purposes of this example, we're using a dataset that has a relatively small number of predictors in each record.
